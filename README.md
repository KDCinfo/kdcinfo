## WIP [2018-01-08]
I'm looking to migrate my old site, done with Zurb Foundation 5, to Foundation 6, and open up a public (read, potential employer) view to its structure.

I enjoyed developing with Blade when I worked on my [2 Laravel sites](https://kdcinfo.com/keeptrack/), so I'm looking forward to working with [Panini](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/panini.html), which works with [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), and appears to be quite similar to Blade. I'm also looking foward to learning what the [Style Sherpa](https://github.com/zurb/style-sherpa) style guiding is all about! The rest of Foundation 6 appears to consist of a lot of the same structure I enjoyed working with in late 2016.

But alas, I'll continue trying to do 1 or 2 daily [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/KeithDC), along with daily efforts on whatever my next React project may be...

## Estimated Timeline
Beginning: 2018-01-09
Completion: 2018-0...(TBD: Best guesstimate: 2-3 months)

## Notes
This will, initially, only include my [Portfolio](https://kdcinfo.com) site, and not my [Resume](https://kdcinfo.com/resume) or [Showcase](https://kdcbase.com/) sites.
